## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an enterprise-level Campus Network using Cisco Packet Tracer.

The network is designed using a three-tier hierarchical architecture consisting of:

- Core Layer  
- Distribution Layer  
- Access Layer  

The implementation includes VLAN segmentation, Inter-VLAN routing (Router-on-a-Stick), DHCP configuration, trunking, server setup, and complete end-to-end connectivity testing.

This project showcases practical enterprise networking skills and Cisco device configuration knowledge.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design a scalable and structured campus network
- Implement VLAN segmentation for departmental isolation
- Configure Inter-VLAN routing
- Set up DHCP for dynamic IP allocation
- Establish secure communication between departments
- Perform network testing and validation

---

## 🏗️ Network Architecture

### 🔹 Core Layer
- Provides backbone connectivity
- Handles routing between distribution devices
- Centralized traffic management

### 🔹 Distribution Layer
- Performs Inter-VLAN routing
- Enforces policies
- Connects Access layer to Core layer

### 🔹 Access Layer
- Connects end-user devices
- Assigns VLANs to switch ports
- Provides direct network access

## 📊 VLAN & IP Addressing Scheme

| VLAN | Department | Network Address     | Default Gateway   |
|------|------------|--------------------|------------------|
| 10   | Admin      | 192.168.10.0/24    | 192.168.10.1     |
| 20   | IT         | 192.168.20.0/24    | 192.168.20.1     |
| 30   | HR         | 192.168.30.0/24    | 192.168.30.1     |
| 40   | Students   | 192.168.40.0/24    | 192.168.40.1     |

## ⚙️ Configuration Highlights

### VLAN Creation (Switch)

```
vlan 10
 name ADMIN

vlan 20
 name IT

vlan 30
 name HR
```

### Access Port Configuration

```
interface fastEthernet0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10
```

### Trunk Configuration

```
interface gigabitEthernet0/1
 switchport mode trunk
```

### Router-on-a-Stick Configuration

```
interface g0/0.10
 encapsulation dot1Q 10
 ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
```

### DHCP Configuration

```
ip dhcp pool ADMIN
 network 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0
 default-router 192.168.10.1
 dns-server 8.8.8.8
```

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

The following validations were performed:

- Same-VLAN connectivity tests
- Inter-VLAN communication verification
- DHCP IP address assignment check
- End-to-end ping tests
- Packet simulation tracking in Packet Tracer

All connectivity tests were successfully verified.
